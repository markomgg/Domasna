    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        I am Marko Acovski, a motivated and ambitious individual currently pursuing my dreams as a university student. Born with a curious mind and a thirst for knowledge,
        I've always seen education as a gateway to endless possibilities. Currently enrolled at FINKI(Facultety of Computer Science and Engineering, I am actively immersing myself
        in the fascinating world of programming. Every day, I wake up eager to absorb new information, engage in thought-provoking discussions, and challenge myself to grow intellectually.
        Within the academic realm, I strive for excellence. As I navigate through various courses, I approach each one with enthusiasm and a desire to grasp its concepts deeply.
        I actively participate in class discussions, ask thought-provoking questions, and seek guidance from my professors and peers to broaden my understanding.
        In addition to my studies and extracurricular involvement, I recognize the importance of personal growth and well-being. I make time for self-care, whether it's through
        engaging in physical activities, exploring creative outlets, or simply spending quality time with friends and loved ones.

        <br/>
        <br/>

        Balancing these aspects of my life enables me to maintain a healthy mindset and approach my studies with renewed vigor. As I progress through my university journey, I am already
        beginning to make connections between my academic pursuits and the real world. I actively seek internships, research opportunities, or part-time work in my field to gain practical
        experience and apply what I've learned in the classroom to real-life situations. These hands-on experiences allow me to develop the skills and confidence necessary for future
        professional success. Looking ahead, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie beyond the walls of the university. I am determined to make a positive impact in my chosen
        field and contribute meaningfully to society. Whether it's through research, innovation, or community engagement, I am eager to leverage my education and skills to make a difference.
